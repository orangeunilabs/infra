# Infrastructure

This repo contains all the things that I use to set up and maintain my web & lab servers. Mostly docker compose files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am currently transitioning to Nix-based configurations for maximum reproducibility. For the time being, this repo will remain dead as I will not be using Docker Compose for a lot of things. This repo may be converted (read: wiped clean and replaced) with a Nix config at some point.
